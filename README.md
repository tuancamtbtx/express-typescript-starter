# Express TypeScript Starter

The Express TypeScript Starter is a boilerplate project that provides a foundation for building web applications using Express.js and TypeScript. It is designed to help developers quickly set up a TypeScript-based environment for creating robust and scalable web APIs.

## Features

- **Express.js**: Utilizes the popular web framework for Node.js, providing a robust foundation for building web applications and APIs.
- **TypeScript**: Enables type safety, enhanced code maintainability, and modern ECMAScript features.
- **Routing**: Includes sample routing setup to handle HTTP requests and endpoints.
- **Middleware**: Demonstrates the use of middleware for request processing, error handling, and more.
- **Dependency Injection**: Utilizes InversifyJS or another DI container for managing application dependencies.
- **Environment Configuration**: Illustrates environment-specific configuration setup for development, testing, and production environments.
- **Testing Setup**: Basic configuration for running unit tests and integration tests using popular testing frameworks such as Jest.

## Prerequisites

- Node.js and npm should be installed on your machine.

## Getting Started

To get started with the Express TypeScript Starter, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository using `git clone https://github.com/your/repo.git`.
2. Navigate to the project directory.
3. Run `npm install` to install dependencies.
4. Start the development server using `npm run dev`.
5. Open a web browser and navigate to `http://localhost:3000` to see the sample application running.

## Project Structure

The project structure is organized to provide a clear separation of concerns, making it easier to navigate and maintain the codebase. Here's a brief overview:

- **src**: Contains the source code for the application.
  - **controllers**: Houses the controller classes, responsible for handling incoming requests and returning responses.
  - **middlewares**: Stores middleware functions for request processing, error handling, and other cross-cutting concerns.
  - **models**: Defines the data models used in the application.
  - **routes**: Contains route definitions and endpoint handling logic.
  - **services**: Contains business logic and service classes.
  - **app.ts**: Entry point for the application, where the Express app is initialized and configured.
- **test**: Includes test scripts and configurations for unit and integration testing.

## Scripts

- `npm run dev`: Starts the development server with hot reloading enabled.
- `npm run build`: Transpiles the TypeScript code to JavaScript for production deployment.
- `npm start`: Starts the application in production mode.
- `npm test`: Runs the test suite to execute unit and integration tests.
- `make fmt`: Run the formatter code
## Configuration

Environment-specific configuration settings can be managed using environment variables or configuration files.
